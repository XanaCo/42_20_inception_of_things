## Overview

The `Inception of Things` (IoT) project is a **system administration** project that introduces students to **Kubernetes**, focusing on **K3s, K3d, and Argo CD**. The goal is to set up a Kubernetes-based infrastructure using **Vagrant**, manage deployments, and automate application delivery.

This project challenges students to **install, configure, and deploy** services using lightweight Kubernetes distributions while learning about **virtualization, container orchestration, and continuous deployment**.

## Key Components

1. **Virtual Machine Setup**: Configure Vagrant to create and manage virtual machines with specific constraints.
2. **K3s Installation**:
   - One server in **server mode**.
   - One server in **agent mode**.
3. **K3s Application Deployment**:
   - Host **three web applications** and configure **Ingress** for traffic routing.
4. **K3d and Argo CD**:
   - Install **K3d** and run a Kubernetes cluster inside Docker.
   - Set up **Argo CD** for continuous deployment.
   - Deploy an application with **two versions** and manage updates using GitOps.
5. **Networking & Security**:
   - Assign dedicated IPs to virtual machines.
   - Enable **passwordless SSH access**.
   - Set up **namespaces and access controls**.
6. **GitLab Integration**:
   - Deploy a self-hosted **GitLab** instance.
   - Integrate it with Kubernetes for CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Skills Developed

1. **Virtualization & Automation**: Learn **Vagrant** to provision and manage virtual environments.
2. **Kubernetes Fundamentals**: Work with **K3s and K3d** to deploy and manage containerized applications.
3. **Networking & Infrastructure**: Set up **dedicated IPs, DNS resolution, and Ingress controllers**.
4. **Container Orchestration**: Deploy applications with **Kubernetes manifests, replicas, and services**.
5. **Continuous Deployment**: Implement **Argo CD** for automated application updates using Git.
6. **Scripting & Configuration**: Automate infrastructure setup with **shell scripts and YAML configuration files**.
7. **Security & Access Management**: Configure **passwordless SSH**, namespaces.
8. **Monitoring & Debugging**: Use Kubernetes tools to **inspect logs, troubleshoot deployments, and manage resources**.
9. **Cloud & DevOps Practices**: Gain experience with **CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and GitHub integration**.
10. **Collaboration & Project Management**: Work with **Git, version control, and peer evaluation** to manage the project efficiently.
